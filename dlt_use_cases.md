# **dlt** Use Cases

**dlt** can be utilized for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to extract data from various sources. Here is an example where dlt could be applied to efficiently extract a real-time dataset of planetary positions and velocities using the NASA Horizons API. For more information, you can visit [the project](https://github.com/YagmurSimsekk/Gravitational-N-Body-Simulation) and the [data extraction file](https://github.com/YagmurSimsekk/Gravitational-N-Body-Simulation/blob/main/packages/data.py).

## Data Extraction

**dlt** enables seamless connectivity with external APIs, including the NASA Horizons API. In my previous project, the extraction of data involved making API calls to the NASA HORIZONS API for regular data updates. When it comes to real-time data extraction, specifically the velocities and positions of moving planets, **dlt** stands out as an exceptionally effective solution. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of **dlt**, users can effortlessly extract data related to planetary positions and velocities, focusing on specific time ranges and celestial bodies of interest.

**dlt** simplifies the process of retrieving data from the API, ensuring the availability of up-to-date information. Moreover, it offers functionalities like incremental loading, which can be immensely beneficial in this context.

## Data Transformation and Normalization

Once the data has been extracted, **dlt** offers the capability to transform and normalize it into a standardized format. This process involves converting the raw data, received in JSON format from the API, into a structured form that is suitable for further analysis and processing. **dlt** excels in its transformation capabilities, which encompass essential tasks such as data cleaning, data type conversions, and unit standardization, ensuring consistency across the dataset. It also provides the flexibility to perform transformations before or after applying the pipeline. **dlt** can be used in conjunction with various libraries for data transformation, such as Pandas and scikit-learn. In this scenario, **dlt** can facilitate the calculation of planetary positions and velocities by converting the data into a dataframe using Pandas.

## Data Loading and Storage

**dlt** provides robust support for loading the transformed and calculated data into a storage destination of choice, including databases and data lakes. It offers seamless integration with popular storage systems through its extensive range of connectors and integrations. This ensures a smooth and efficient integration with your preferred data storage solution.

## Real-time Data Updates

By leveraging the capabilities of **dlt**, users can easily configure automated processes to fetch updated data from the NASA Horizons API at regular intervals. This automation ensures that users have access to the most up-to-date planetary positions and velocities at all times. This real-time data availability enables continuous monitoring and analysis of planetary movements, facilitating timely insights and informed decision-making.



# Potential Use Cases

## Fine-tuning LLM Models with dlt

Fine-tuning entails adapting a pre-trained language model to perform specific tasks or exhibit desired behavior. Within the realm of LLMs like GPT-3, fine-tuning empowers users to customize the model's responses and behavior according to their specific requirements. A crucial aspect of this process is the availability of a reliable dataset. To fine-tune an LLM for a particular task, a relevant dataset is essential. This dataset typically consists of labeled examples containing input sequences and corresponding target outputs. For example, sentiment analysis necessitates a dataset with text samples labeled as positive or negative sentiment. **dlt** offers a solution for preprocessing and preparing data for fine-tuning LLM models.

By leveraging **dlt**, text data can be extracted from diverse sources such as databases, APIs, files, or web scraping. Once the data is extracted, **dlt** provides data transformation capabilities to preprocess the extracted data. This preprocessing step involves text cleaning, removal of irrelevant information, format normalization, and handling missing values or duplicates. A robust preprocessing stage ensures high-quality input data for fine-tuning purposes.

To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned LLM and prevent overfitting, **dlt** facilitates the splitting of preprocessed data into training, validation, and testing sets.

During each iteration, **dlt** efficiently loads and feeds the training data to the LLM model using its data loading capabilities. This seamless integration ensures a streamlined and effective fine-tuning process.
